Generates RP prompts and BINGO cards.

# Overview
This plugin has two functions: It outputs a short list of random RP prompts and uses the same list to create a roleplay BINGO card.

Using the `prompts [#]` command, players can see a list of random RP prompts, up to [#} (default is 5).  Using the `bingo` command, they can create a copy-paste friendly BINGO sheet.

This plugin is designed to work with the webportal and has a couple of additional steps to complete that functionality.

# Installation
